/**
 * In time series analysis, dynamic time warping (DTW) is an algorithm for measuring similarity
 * between two temporal sequences which may vary in time or speed.
 * <p>
 * In general, DTW is a method that calculates an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g.
 * time series) with certain restrictions. The sequences are "warped" non-linearly in the time
 * dimension to determine a measure of their similarity independent of certain non-linear variations
 * in the time dimension. This sequence alignment method is often used in time series
 * classification. Although DTW measures a distance-like quantity between two given sequences, it
 * doesn't guarantee the triangle inequality to hold.

 * A classifier is a function {@code f(X, y)} which produces a hypothesis {@code g = X -> y} that as
 * accurately as possible model the true function {@code h} used to generate {@code X -> y}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The input {@code x} is usually denoted as the instances and the output {@code y} as the classes.
 * The input instances is represented as a {@link DataFrame} which consists of possibly
 * heterogeneous vectors of values characterizing each instance.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The output of the classifier is a {@link Classifier} (i.e., the {@code g}) which (hopefully)
 * approximates {@code h}. To estimate how well {@code g} approximates {@code h}, cross-validation
 * {@link ClassifierValidator#crossValidation(int)} can be employed.
 * </p>
 *
 * A classifier is always atomic, i.e. does not have mutable state.

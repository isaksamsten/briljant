 * The leave-one-out partitioner can be used to implement Leave-one-out cross-validation, a commonly
 * employed strategy for evaluating small and expensive to gather datasets.
 *
 * <p/>
 * The {@linkplain DataFrame} (with {@code m} rows) and {@linkplain Vector} (of length {@code m})
 * are partitioned into {@code m} partitions. At each iteration {@code m-1} data points are returned
 * as the training set and {@code 1} data point as the validation set. All data points are used as
 * validation points exactly once.
